    bio: "After playing college football for Georgia Tech, Anoa`i started his professional football career with brief off-season stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) in 2007. He then played a full season for the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football. He then pursued a career in professional wrestling and was signed by WWE in 2010, reporting to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). Under the ring name Roman Reigns, he made his main roster debut in 2012 as a member of The Shield alongside Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins. They teamed together until disbanding in 2014, after which Reigns entered singles competition, though the trio would occasionally reunite until Ambrose left WWE in 2019.",

    bio: "First scouted by WWE officials while smashing his way through the college wrestling ranks, Lesnar debuted on Raw March 18, 2002, and singlehandedly destroyed a ring full of unfortunate Superstars. From that night on, the domination was unrepentant. With the sinister Paul Heyman guiding his career, “The Next Big Thing” won the King of the Ring tournament and beat The Rock to win the WWE Title — becoming the youngest WWE Champion in history at that time and the fastest-rising star sports-entertainment had ever seen.",
